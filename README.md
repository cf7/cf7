# Introduction

Hello! I'm Chris. I'm a junior developer seeking opportunities to learn cutting edge technologies in leading organizations.  I have Full Stack experience building applications with React, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL, and AWS Services as well as some DevOps experience. I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, especially when they involve architecture and software infrastructure design decisions. 

In the future, I hope to grow my skills into the Machine Learning and Data Science spaces.

# Personal Projects
Here are some simple take-home projects from previous interviews I've worked on.

## Sample Landing Page
- A frontend-only landing page that I coded up in a day based on a figma design.
- Frontend Code: [https://github.com/cf7/landing-page](https://github.com/cf7/landing-page)

## Titlebot Mini-App
- A simple app that takes home page urls, scrapes the html, and displays the `<title>` of the home page.
- It comes with a mini-API backend implemented with `AWS Lambda` and `AWS API Gateway` that provides a single endpoint.
- The backend receives a request with the user-provided `url`, makes an http request to grab the `html` from the site the url points to, parses through the html to find the `<title>` tag, and finally, returns the site's `title` in its response to the frontend.
