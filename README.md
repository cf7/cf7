I'm a junior developer seeking opportunities to learn cutting edge technologies in leading organizations. I have Full Stack experience working with React, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL, and AWS applications. In the future, I hope to grow my skills into Machine Learning and Data Science spaces.

Here are some past projects I've worked on, some of which were take-home projects for previous interviews.

### Sample Landing Page
- A frontend-only landing page that I coded up in about 12 hours based on a figma design.

### Titlebot Mini-App
- A simple app that takes home page urls, scrapes the html, and displays the `<title>` of the home page.
- It comes with a mini-API backend implemented with `AWS Lambda` and `AWS API Gateway` that provides a single endpoint.
- The backend receives a request with the user-provided `url`, makes an http request to grab the `html` from the site the url points to, parses through the html to find the `<title>` tag, and finally, returns the site's `title` in its response to the frontend.
