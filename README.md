### Welcome!

I am a junior developer ready to move onto the next level of software engineering. Since graduating with my Bachelors in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University, I spent three years out of state to pursue my masters degree with a focus on Social Justice and Homelessness Organizing. During this time I've been keeping up my coding skills by taking graduate level computer science classes in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
