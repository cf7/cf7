# Introduction

Hello! I'm Chris. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer seeking opportunities to learn cutting edge technologies in leading organizations. I have proven experience building applications with React, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL, and AWS Services as well as some DevOps experience. I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, especially when they involve architecture, data, and software design decisions. 

In the near future, I hope to grow my skills into the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence spaces.

### * Updates:
  - I've been working at a fast-paced startup for the last few years, which unfortunately means that I don't have recent personal projects to show off due to lack of free time -- so below are some small one-off projects I've done for interviews as well as my undergrad senior thesis project from years ago.
  - Please note that these are from a few years ago. My skills have grown considerably since then.

# Personal Projects
Here are some simple take-home projects from previous interviews I've worked on.

## Interview Take-Home: Sample Landing Page (2021)
- A frontend-only landing page that I coded up in a day based on a figma design.
- Frontend Code: [https://github.com/cf7/landing-page](https://github.com/cf7/landing-page)
- **Website: [https://landing-page-04.vercel.app/](https://landing-page-04.vercel.app/)**

## Interview Take-Home: Titlebot Mini-App (2021)
- A simple app that takes home page urls, scrapes the html, and displays the `<title>` of the home page.
- It comes with a mini-API backend implemented with `AWS Lambda` and `AWS API Gateway` that provides a single endpoint.
- The backend receives a request with the user-provided `url`, makes an http request to grab the `html` from that site, parses the html to find the `<title>` tag, and finally, returns the site's `title` in its response to the frontend.
- Frontend Code: [https://github.com/cf7/titlebot](https://github.com/cf7/titlebot)
- Backend Code: [https://github.com/cf7/titlebot-lambda](https://github.com/cf7/titlebot-lambda)
- **Website: [https://titlebot.vercel.app/](https://titlebot.vercel.app/)**

## Undergraduate Thesis Project (2017)

[SPY App](https://github.com/cf7/SPY) ~ a prototype web application for a small nonprofit in Venice, CA.
Tech Stack: 
- Frontend: React.js / JQuery
- Backend: Node.js / Hapi.js
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Testing: Mocha.js / Chai.js
- Hosting: Heroku
__Important Note: Since I switched my email address linked to my github account,\
my contribution history insights were erased from the SPY repo. Manually looking\
through the [commit history](https://github.com/cf7/SPY/commits/master) will very clearly reveal that I am the primary contributor\
for the SPY project.
(Also, please excuse the comments everywhere as it is also an educational project.)__
