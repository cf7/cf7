### Welcome!

I am a junior developer ready to move onto the next level of software engineering. Since graduating with my Bachelors in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University, I spent three years out of state to pursue my passion of service immersion in and around homelessness in impoverished communities. During that time I was able to earn my masters degree with a focus on Social Justice and Homelessness Organizing as well as keep up my coding skills by taking graduate level computer science classes in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

However, I've finally moved back to Los Angeles and am ready to dive back into the world of software development!

It would be awesome if I could not only gain more full stack experience but also do so in the service of those less fortunate. Fortunately, I already have a bit of full stack experience from my main app development project: [SPY Database](https://github.com/cf7/SPY).
