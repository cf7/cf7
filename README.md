I'm a junior developer seeking opportunities to learn cutting edge technologies in leading organizations. I have Full Stack experience working with React, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL, and AWS based applications. In the future, I hope to grow my skills into Machine Learning and Data Science spaces.

Here are some past projects I've worked on. Some were take-home projects for previous interviews.

### Sample Landing Page
- a landing page (frontend-only) that I coded up in about 12 hours from a figma design

[https://landing-page-04.vercel.app/](https://landing-page-04.vercel.app/)

### Titlebot Mini-App
- a simple app that takes home page urls and displays the title of the home page
- I needed to use a Node.js Express server to make cross-site requests from the backend to get around CORS restrictions and the "Same Origin Policy"
