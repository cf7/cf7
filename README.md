# Welcome!

I am a junior developer seeking an entry-level software engineering position. After graduating at the top of my class with my Bachelors in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University, I spent three years out of state to pursue my passion of service immersion in and around homelessness in impoverished communities. During that time I was able to earn a Master's degree in Social Justice and Homelessness Organizing as well as keep up my coding skills by taking graduate level computer science classes in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

However, I've finally moved back to Los Angeles and am ready to dive back into the world of software development!

My hopes are to gain more full stack experience and do so in the service of those less fortunate by working for an organization that makes a positive impact. Fortunately, I already have a bit of full stack experience from my main app development project: [SPY Database](https://github.com/cf7/SPY). __(Important Note: Since I switched my email addresses linked to my github account, my contribution history insights were erased from the repo. However, manually looking through the commit history will very clearly reveal that I am the primary contributor for the project.)__ (Please excuse the comments everywhere as it is an educational project as well.)

I am comfortable with not knowing things at first. What I lack in experience I make up for in learning speed and hard-earned lessons. (i.e. "Test-Driven Development is the name of the game. Spending a lot of time reading documentation for a few lines of code is okay because, in the end, more time is saved than brute-forcing the problem. Lint your code. Always try solutions on paper/whiteboard before writing code. Always git pull before you start coding. Lint your code. Imagine your code in multiple languages. DRY code. Then DRY the DRY code. Naming is very important. Is it Portable? Scalable? Reusable? Revisit math fundamentals.)

For me, software development is about more than just grinding away at the code. It's realizing that code is a translation of the relationship between our minds and the machine, the clocks and lists that fold spacetime and allow us to see beyond. I hope to use the languages of mind and machine to create a more socially just world.
