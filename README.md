# Welcome!

I am a junior developer ready to move onto the next level of software engineering. After graduating at the top of my class with my Bachelors in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University, I spent three years out of state to pursue my passion of service immersion in and around homelessness in impoverished communities. During that time I was able to earn my masters degree with a focus on Social Justice and Homelessness Organizing as well as keep up my coding skills by taking graduate level computer science classes in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

However, I've finally moved back to Los Angeles and am ready to dive back into the world of software development!

It would be awesome if I could not only gain more full stack experience but also do so in the service of those less fortunate by working for an organization that makes an impact. Fortunately, I already have a bit of full stack experience from my main app development project: [SPY Database](https://github.com/cf7/SPY). __(Important Note: Since I switched my email addresses linked to my github account, my contribution history insights were erased from the repo. However, manually looking through the commit history will very clearly reveal that I am the primary contributor for the project.)__

The SPY Database was my undergraduate thesis project and the reason I didn't eat or sleep for 12 months. I was fortunate to partner with [Safe Place for Youth](https://www.safeplaceforyouth.org/), a youth homeless services organization based in Venice, CA, to implement a database-driven web application for their staff and case managers. (You can read about the project description [here](https://github.com/cf7/SPY/blob/master/docs/Project_Proposal.md).) 

Like many ambitious thesis projects, it was a complete flop, but as we developers like to say, "Fail early and fail often!" (Half our team got away with not doing any work whatsoever.)

The beauty of the project lies in what happened behind the scenes. As project manager, I had already developed a relationship with the organization who then approached me with the project vision so that by the time the semester started, I was able to recruit a team of 9 classmates. 

# The Process

## Design Thinking
Most importantly, we went through the entire [Design Thinking](https://web.stanford.edu/~mshanks/MichaelShanks/files/509554.pdf) phase before writing a single line of code. We recorded interviews with staff and case managers where they told us what they wanted to do and how they wanted to use the platform. We co-designed user stories and wireframes with them. We toured the organization and met the clients, and we role-played how the platform would exist within the organization.

## Prototyping
We built a very cheap and easy prototype frontend for the platform based on this initial inquiry phase so that the staff could gain insights and provide invaluable early feedback before we spent weeks on features they neither needed nor wanted. This also helped hone the vision and helped us devise a development strategy. 

## Workflow Design
We chopped up the project vision into features, each of which had workflows that spanned the entire pipeline of the application, front-to-back. 

I had the idea that we could choose one 

## Scrum/Kanban Cycle
After the initial prototype, it was off to the races! 

It was at this point of the process that I had to learn fullstack development on the fly and train my team.
