I'm a junior developer seeking opportunities to learn cutting edge technologies in leading organizations. I have Full Stack experience working with React, Javascript, Python, PostgreSQL, and AWS based applications. In the future, I hope to grow my skills into Machine Learning and Data Science spaces.

Here are some past projects I've worked on. Some were take-home projects for previous interviews.

### Sample Landing Page
- a landing page (frontend-only) that I coded up in about 12 hours from a figma design

[https://landing-page-04.vercel.app/](https://landing-page-04.vercel.app/)

### Titlebot Mini-App
- a simple app that takes home page urls and displays the title of the home page
- it comes with a mini-API backend implemented with `AWS Lambda` and `AWS API Gateway` with a single endpoint
- The backend receives a request with the user-provided `url`, makes an http request to grab the `html` from the site the url points to, parses through the html to find the `<title/>` tag, and finally returns the site's `title` in the response to the frontend.
- The backend Python code for all this can be found here [https://github.com/cf7/titlebot-lambda](https://github.com/cf7/titlebot-lambda)
