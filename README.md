# Welcome!

I am a junior developer seeking internships and entry-level software development positions. After graduating at the top of my class with my Bachelors in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University, I spent three years out of state to pursue my passion of service immersion in and around homelessness in impoverished communities. During that time I was able to earn a Master's degree in Social Justice and Homelessness Organizing as well as keep up my coding skills by taking graduate level computer science classes in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

However, I've finally moved back to Los Angeles and am ready to dive back into the world of software development! My hopes are to gain as much frontend, full stack, or devops experience as I can working for an organization that makes a positive impact.

I already have a tiny bit of full stack experience from my 10-month senior thesis project:

[SPY Database](https://github.com/cf7/SPY) ~ a prototype database management system for a small nonprofit in Venice, CA.

Tech Stack: 
- Frontend: React.js/JQuery
- Backend: Node.js/Hapi.js
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Testing: Mocha.js/Chai.js
- Hosting: Heroku

__Important Note: Since I switched my email address linked to my github account,\
my contribution history insights were erased from the SPY repo. Manually looking\
through the [commit history](https://github.com/cf7/SPY/commits/master) will very clearly reveal that I am the primary contributor\
for the SPY project.
(Also, please excuse the comments everywhere as it is an educational project.)__

Here's my latest project!

[Fourier](https://github.com/cf7/Fourier) ~ a sandbox interface where I demonstrate my meager web development skills for potential employers.

Tech Stack: 
- Fronted: React.js
- Backend: Node.js/Express.js
- ML Model: Tensorflow/Keras
- Bundler: Webpack
- Testing: Jest.js/Enzyme.js
- Hosting: Heroku

Fourier uses a Sequence-to-Sequence neural network with LSTM layers, the code for which is featured on my [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/cf1111/fourier4).\
And here is the same [Fourier](https://github.com/cf7/v-fourier) interface . . . but built with __Vue.js__! (work in progress as I learn the framework)

Here are some of my cool university projects:

[AvaJava](https://github.com/cf7/AvaJava) *(Lead Developer)*
- Designed and coded a functioning compiler (with custom hand-coded parser (not auto generated from a parser-generator))
- Designed language features
- Managed development process for team

[3D Scene](https://github.com/cf7/cmsi371/tree/master/pipeline)
- Designed Interactive Scene using WebGL 3D browser-based graphics
- Built 3D Library of basic geometric shapes

[Sprites](https://github.com/cf7/cmsi371/tree/master/sprites)
- Designed parameterized sprites using HTML canvas graphics to build a two-dimensional animated scene
- Implemented scene in a web browser using Javascript keyframe/tweening library
- Built 2D Sprite Library using browser-based canvas graphics
